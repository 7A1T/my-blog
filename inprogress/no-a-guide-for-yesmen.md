# Saying no is hard

A yesman, human doormat, pushover, people pleaser. All of these are terms for people who have a hard time saying no.
They all have very negative connotations don't they? What about adventurerers, explorers, or people who are open to new experiences?
What differentiates the first group from the second?

The key is knowing when to say no. Saying no is hard, but it's important to do so.

The hardest person to say no to is likely yourself. You have to be able to say no to yourself to be able to say no to others.
My biggest obsticle when I am building personal projects is avoiding jumping from project to project, resulting in 50 github repos with 12 broken commits each.
When you don't say no to yourself, you end up with a lot of half finished projects, and no time to finish them.
